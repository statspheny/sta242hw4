* Get the data
There were a lot of files to get, and I didn't want to have to
download all of them single-handedly, so I looked to see if it was
possible to find a shell script that would it automatically for me.  I
found the function ~wget~.  Then I found a tutorial at
http://www.freeos.com/guides/lsst/index.html for basic information for shell
scripting.  I ended up writing a for loop and ~wget~ the data from
each year.
